Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2C. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1. First we checked the approximate size of each event which is present on the given sample     
    image. Every event is around 51*51 pixels, so we took 50*50 pixels(rounded off) . Now we have 
    learnt syntax by browsing through different websites( geeksforgeeks ,etc..) for how to crop an 
    image in numpy, PyTorch and we cropped those 5 events and saved them in the event_list. 
2. Since the given arena is read using openCV, so cv.imread() will import it as numpy array,    
    whereas trained model takes input only PyTorch tensors. We cant directly transform a numpy 
    array of a color image to PyTorch tensor , because in PyTorch images have the format (C,H,W) 
    whereas in numpy they have the format (H,W,C) and also RGB becomes BGR when you 
    transform from numpy to PyTorch. So after browsing through different resources, we finally 
    figured out how to transform that numpy array properly into PyTorch tensor (so that we dont 
    encounter the dimensions rotated issue or BGR-RGB issue). 
3. Now we used the similar trained model that we used in task_2b 
4. Finally used the trained model to classify the images of event_list
